# Weekly Questions
## 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
This homework cycle, I worked on understanding Git and Terminal. I did a lot of experimenting in both, by just typing and seeing what happened. I learn well with hands-on experimenting, so it was helpful for me to go into the programs and just mess around a bit to see how it works.
## 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
- I went through the website and did the reading and watched the videos.
- Then, I went through again and began interacting and experimenting with programs while referencing the class readings.
- Then, once I'd understood how each program used in this lesson worked, I began following the tutorials, and doing the assigned work.
- Uploaded work to ![github](github.com)
## 3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
I had some trouble understanding exactly what Git *was*, so I did some research of my own through Google, as well as familiarizing myself with the program through interaction.
## 4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
I'd like to know more about MarkDown, specifically the difference between MarkDown and HTML.
## 5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
I probably wasn't much help to any of my classmates this homework cycle, I was having a hard time understanding it
 myself.
