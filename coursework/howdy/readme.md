### 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
This week, I tried to do something similar to the example, and make balls bounce off of each other.
### 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
I first went through the content on the website. I then tried to follow the examples from class in Atom. Then I tried to alter them, and mix other parts in.
### 3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
I couldn't figure out how to get multiple balls in my sketch. It may be that there are multiple balls in my sketch, and they are just layered on top of one another, and in that case, I couldn't get the code to make the circles not layer on top of each other to work.
### 4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
I was really confused about a lot in this section. I really needed help with getting multiple objects into my sketch in the first place.
### 5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
I didn't do much discussing in the class repo this week.
