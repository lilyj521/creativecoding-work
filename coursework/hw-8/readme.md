### 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
This week I went into Atom and began playing around with different functions, learning how they worked, and becoming familiar with the parameters. I then began to construct my monster portrait. I started with the background, and then moved to the head and body. I used a lot of ellipses, but I also used the triangle, point, and arc.
### 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
First, I watched the videos and read the material provided on the website. Then, I went into Atom and began playing around with different functions, learning how they worked, and becoming familiar with the parameters. I then began to construct my monster portrait. I started with the background, and then moved to the head and body. I used a lot of ellipses, but I also used the triangle and arc. Once I was finished, I uploaded my work to my repository.
### 3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
At first I was having issue with my index.html not bringing anything up in the browser. I posted about it in the class repo issue tracker, but then just decided to delete the hw-4 folder I was working in and make a new one. That solved it, so I still don't know what the issue was with that folder.
### 4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
I had a hard time getting familiar with things like how much 500px is, since it's a unit of measurement I haven't used much before. It also took me a bit to get used to understanding x and y-coordinates and how they correspond with where my shapes and objects go.
### 5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
I had a discussion about an issue I was having with my index.html in the class issues repo.
