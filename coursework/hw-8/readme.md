### 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
This week, I tried to make a cute design using loops. I was more focused on it looking nice than doing something cool. I wanted to make a nice little pattern that could maybe be used as a background or something, and I think I succeeded in this effort.
### 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
First I went through and watched the videos and read the tutorials on the class website, and then I did some experimenting in Atom. I tried lots of different things before settling on an idea I liked. I went into the P5 library to see if there were any new functions that might fit this week's homework. Then I started really working on my project and bringing my concept to life.
### 3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
I had an issue getting the mouseClicked function to work, so I tried to use mousePressed, but I couldn't get that to work either, so I just decided that the pattern looked fine stagnant.
### 4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
I would really like to learn more about the mousePressed and mouseClicked functions because I've consistently had a hard time getting them to work and I don't know why.
### 5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
I didn't do much discussing in the class repo this week.
