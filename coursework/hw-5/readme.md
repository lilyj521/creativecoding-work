### 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
This homework cycle, I spent a lot of time experimenting with functions from the p5 reference page, and with the code on the class website. It helped me get more familiar with the new variables.
### 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
First, I read through everything on the class website. Then, I went back through and experimented in the code on the class website. Then I opened Atom and started experimenting by myself, and finding new things on the p5 reference page. Then I started putting things together and checking my index.html to see my progress.
### 3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
I had an issue getting the mousePressed function to work, so I went on the p5 reference page and found a similar function, if (mouseIsPressed).
### 4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
I learned that you need background() in setup() if you want to be able to use it like a paintbrush, but it has to be in draw() if you want it to change colors, which meant I couldn't have my background change colors AND be able to use the mouse as a brush. This was a bit frustrating and I wonder if there is any way to have both of these things at once.
### 5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
I commented on a fellow students issue about a problem they were having that I had last homework cycle, and offered some advice on what worked for me.
