### 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
This week I worked on understanding p5 and the use of functions and parameters. I studied the way different functions can be used and what parameters they accept, as well as how p5 and HTML are both similar and different.
### 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
I first went through all the sources we were given on the website, and practiced the different functions in Atom. I then experimented a bit with these functions, to become more familiar with them. I also used the resources on the p5 website to look at different functions. I then followed the instructions to complete the homework.
### 3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
I had an issue when telling p5 to print the text string, it wasnt showing up in my index.html. I went back and looked at the instructions more closely and found I was missing a little piece of code.
### 4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
I learned about how functions and parameters work which was interesting. It seemed similar to elements in HTML.
### 5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
I discussed issues with another classmate regarding a 404 error when adding /hw-3 to the url.
