### 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
This week I reworked my homework from week 4 to include an array and use a function of my own creation. I made a function called createMonster that, as the name suggests, creates a monster. The parameters control the size and location of the monster.
### 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
First, I watched the videos and read the material provided on the website. Then, I messed around in the examples a bit to understand how things work. Then, I went through previous projects to decide which would be best to edit. Once I chose week 4's homework, I had to decide what I was going to do with it. As the monster is the main focus of this sketch, I figured I'd work with that. I had to figure out all the proportional ratios of the body parts of the monster in relation to each other. Once I did this, I was able to insert the variables into my sketch and use the function.
### 3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
At first, the math of the body parts tripped me up. I first tried adding and subtracting percentages from variables. I then realized it is much easier to use multiplication for this purpose.
### 4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
I'd like to learn more about creating your own functions. Mine didn't exactly work out how I wanted. It only really works proportionally if all four arguments are the same number.
### 5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
I mostly worked in my own sketch this week.
