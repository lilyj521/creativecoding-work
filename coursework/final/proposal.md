## Final Proposal
For my final, I'm hoping to create a simple game that launches a ball into a "goal". It would be an ellipse that when clicked, or possibly dragged, would move across the screen into a "goal", perhaps a square or other shape. The direction of the ellipse would be random, but once the player gets the "ball" in the "goal", text would display saying they won. I am inspired by other simple games such as Pong.

### Possible Issues
One thing I have had issues with in the past is the mouseClicked function. I will surely have to use this function in this project, so I'll have to work harder on making sure it works. I also may have issue with making the ball move in a random direction, but I should be able to overcome these issues.

### Timeline
I plan to use the first few days of my project to play around a bit and just see what works. Then, For the rest of the first week and second week, I'll start writing the code. I'll spend the last week tweaking and perfecting the code.
