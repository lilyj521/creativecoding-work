### 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
This homework cycle, I spent a lot of time trying to understand how to work through the math. I'm not a mathematically minded person, so I had to work to understand things like modulo.
### 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
I read through the class website and watched the videos. Then I did some of my own research on modulo. Then I experimented in Atom by myself, and then I began my homework.
### 3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
I had an issue getting modulo to work, which was interesting because I used it successfully in last week's assignment. I was trying to make my line that moves through the page start over once it reached the edge, but modulo either stopped it, or moved it really far to the left. I used google to try to find answers.
### 4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
I'd like to find out why modulo wasn't working for me this time around.
### 5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
I was too focused on figuring out math to help others, I probably wouldn't be much help with this type of work.
